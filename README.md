# TODO: Read Me

This is a tile-based set of rendering functions around which a simple RPG may be created. The overall look-and-feel, such as main character position and scroll speed, was inspired by the original Pokèmon Game Boy games.

# Thanks

Thanks to the TICT for their [ExtGraph library](https://github.com/debrouxl/ExtGraph). I have included modified versions of a few functions from the library, in addition to the core library. http://tict.ticalc.org
